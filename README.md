Step 2: Fork the repository, then go to the copy of this repository you just forked. <br />
 <br />
Step 3: Click "Code" then navigate to codespaces tab, then click the + button next to the "Your workspaces in the cloud" A new tab will open in VS Code. <br />
 <br />
Step 4: In your newly open tab there will be a grid like symbol with a box out of the grid on the left side of the screen. Its also called "Extensions". You can also use the Ctrl+Shift+X command once you are on the new tab to open the extension slide.  <br />
 <br />
Step 5: Once you open the extension tab a search bar will appear at the top. In that search bar TYPE "Live Server by Ritwick Dey". The extension "Live server" by Ritwick Dey will appear. Click Install. <br />
 <br />
Step 6: Once installed click on the 2 pages looking like symbol. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E. Once you open that tab, Right click on the file named "index.html" and select the first option called "Open with Live Server" <br />
 <br />
Step 7: A new tab will appear and wait for it to load. If you are not automatically redirected to the Live server page a poppup should appear in the bottom right corner. Saying something along the lines "Your application is running on port 5502" or some random number. On that popup just click open in browser and the website with the game should still load. <br />
 <br />
Step 8: Once the new tab is loaded there will be two buttons and two blank boxes. Click the button "Start Game" and wait for 2 seconds, the game will begin.  <br />
